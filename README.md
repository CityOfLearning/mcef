# MCEF [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Digital-Youth-Network/mcef.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Digital-Youth-Network/mcef)
Minecraft Chromium Embedded Framework (MCEF) is an API to allow Minecraft Modders to add custom web browsers into Minecraft.
The project was initialy made for WebDisplays (www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1291044-web-displays-browse-on-the-internet-in-minecraft).
It is based on JCEF (https://code.google.com/p/javachromiumembedded/), which is based on CEF (https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/) which is based on chromium (http://www.chromium.org).

# Features
- 2D & 3D web view rendering (not only in GUIs)
- Java -> JavaScript (IBrowser.runJavaScript)
- JavaScript -> Java (IJSQueryHandler)
- Embedded files (mod://modname/file.html => /assets/modname/html/file.html)
- Flash, HTML5, CSS3 are supported.

# What can I do with this?
- If you're tired of Minecraft's GuiScreen, you can make a HTML/JS/CSS GUI.
- Open a link to your wiki.
- If you're a server manager, what about displaying some ADs?
- Everything else, but please no WebDisplays clone.

# Currently supported platforms
Right now MCEF supports Windows 32 and 64 bits. I'll compile JCEF for linux as soon as possible. However I can't compile it for Mac.
If you want to compile the natives for Mac, you can follow the instructions here: https://code.google.com/p/javachromiumembedded/wiki/BranchesAndBuilding
On checkout, please take the revision 113.

# For modders
You just need to copy the net.montoyo.mcef.api package into your project. Users will have to download the mod from the MinecraftForum thread.
To understand how it works, you may look at the net.montoyo.mcef.example package, which contains an example browser.

# For players
This is the Github project of MCEF; here you can only read the source code of it.
You can download the mod in its latest version from here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2324969-minecraft-chromium-embedded-framework-mcef
